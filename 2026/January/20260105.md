# 20260105

Today, I learned from [netninja.dev](https://netninja.dev) in the Git & GitHub Masterclass to refresh my skills about GitHub in general.

## What I learned today

- `git restore --staged <file_name>` will restore the file from the staging area (after doing `git add .`)
- `git restore <file_name>` will restore the file to the previous version, even after deleting it.
- `git rm --cached <file_name>` will untrack a file. Without the `--cached` flag, it will remove the files from the project. Additionally, if you track the file again by `git add <file_name>` and stage it, it will come back again. Useful if you want to keep the files around without tracking them.
- `git log` will show the history of git commits. Adding the `--oneline` flag will show the history in one line. To check the details of each commit, use `git show <hash_number>`. This is useful for finding a bug.
- `git diff <1st_hash_number> <2nd_hash_number>` will compare the differences between two specific git commits.
- `git revert` undoes a previous commit by making a new commit on top of your history. This will open a `COMMIT_EDITMSG`. You will notice that the old commit still exists.
- `git reset` moves your project back to a previous commit, for example `git reset --hard <hash_number>`. To check the details after doing this, use `git reflog`. Without the `--hard` flag, it will reset the HEAD and leave the changes as unstaged files.
